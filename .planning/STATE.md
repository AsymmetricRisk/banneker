Plan: —
Status: Milestone 1 initialized, ready to plan first phase
Last activity: 2026-02-02 — Milestone 1 started

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-02)

**Core value:** Transform structured discovery interviews into engineering plans, architecture diagrams, and agent-ready HTML appendices
**Current focus:** Milestone 1 — Package Scaffolding & Installer

## Current Milestone: v0.2.0

**Goal:** Build Banneker from specification to published npm package

**Current milestone scope:** Milestone 1 — Package Scaffolding & Installer

## Accumulated Context

- Zero runtime dependencies constraint (Node.js built-ins only)
- Multi-runtime support from day one (Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini)
- Installer writes to `~/` — needs high confidence before publishing
- Pre-1.0 versioning at 0.2.0
