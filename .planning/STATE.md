# Banneker — State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-03)

**Core value:** Transform structured discovery interviews into engineering plans, architecture diagrams, and agent-ready HTML appendices
**Current focus:** Milestone v0.3.0 — The Engineer (Phase 11: Engineer Agent Core)

## Current Position

Phase: 11 of 15 (Engineer Agent Core)
Plan: 0 of 4 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-03 — v0.3.0 roadmap created

Progress: [##########..........] 50% (v0.2.0 nearly complete, v0.3.0 starting)

## Current Milestone: v0.3.0

**Goal:** Add `/banneker:engineer` command that shifts from interviewing to engineering mode when users reach their knowledge limits

**Phases:**
- Phase 11: Engineer Agent Core (standalone synthesis)
- Phase 12: Cliff Detection (signal detection + confirmation)
- Phase 13: Approval Flow (user approval before merge)
- Phase 14: Survey Integration (mid-survey takeover)
- Phase 15: Polish & Advanced Detection (implicit signals, complexity ceiling)

**Requirements:** 17 total (CLIFF: 4, ENGDOC: 6, APPROVE: 4, ENGINT: 5)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 32 (v0.2.0)
- Average duration: ~15 min
- Total execution time: ~8 hours

**By Phase (v0.2.0):**

| Phase | Plans | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1-9 | 31/31 | Complete |
| 10 | 1/2 | In progress |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting v0.3.0 work:

- Zero runtime dependencies constraint continues
- Multi-runtime support (Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini)
- New agent (banneker-engineer) separate from surveyor
- Three-document output: DIAGNOSIS.md, RECOMMENDATION.md, ENGINEERING-PROPOSAL.md

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 10 (v0.2.0 Public Launch) has 1 remaining plan before v0.3.0 can start
- Approval flow UX needs validation during Phase 13 planning
