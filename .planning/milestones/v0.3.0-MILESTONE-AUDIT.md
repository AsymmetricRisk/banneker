## End-to-End Flows

### Flow 1: Survey with Cliff Signal → Engineer Handoff
1. Survey runs → cliff signal detected → mode switch offered → user accepts
2. surveyor_notes written → surveyor-context.md written → engineer invoked
3. Engineer reads handoff → DIAGNOSIS.md generated with Handoff Context section

**Status: COMPLETE**

### Flow 2: Engineer → Approval → Merge
1. Engineer generates DIAGNOSIS.md, RECOMMENDATION.md, ENGINEERING-PROPOSAL.md
2. ENGINEERING-PROPOSAL.md contains DEC-XXX formatted decisions
3. /banneker:approve reads proposals → user reviews → merge to architecture-decisions.json

**Status: COMPLETE**

### Flow 3: Compound Cliff Detection (Implicit Signals)
1. User response processed → recentHistory updated → detectCompound() called
2. Threshold check (2+ implicit signals) → MEDIUM confidence offer triggered

**Status: COMPLETE**

### Flow 4: Complexity Ceiling Enforcement
1. Survey provides constraints → extractConstraints() determines maxComplexity
2. Recommendation generated → checkComplexity() validates against ceiling
3. Violations flagged in RECOMMENDATION.md (warnings, not blocks)

**Status: COMPLETE**

**Score: 4/4 flows complete**

## Test Coverage

| Category | Tests | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| cliff-detection unit | 33 | PASS |
| complexity-ceiling unit | 19 | PASS |
| approval unit | 25 | PASS |
| surveyor integration | 23+ | PASS |
| approval integration | 15+ | PASS |
| installer integration | 50+ | PASS |
| **Total** | **260** | **PASS** |

## Tech Debt

None accumulated. All phases completed without deferred items.

## Summary

v0.3.0 milestone "The Engineer" is complete:

- **Cliff Detection:** Explicit (14 signals) and implicit (24 signals) detection with compound threshold (2+ required)
- **Engineer Agent:** Three-document output (DIAGNOSIS, RECOMMENDATION, ENGINEERING-PROPOSAL) with confidence markers
- **Approval Flow:** Granular per-decision approval with edit-before-accept and rejection logging
- **Survey Integration:** Mid-survey mode switch with surveyor_notes + surveyor-context.md handoff
- **Advanced Features:** Complexity ceiling enforcement, research-on-demand (3 queries/session)

All 17 requirements satisfied. All 5 phases verified. All cross-phase connections wired. All E2E flows complete. No tech debt.

**Ready for release.**
