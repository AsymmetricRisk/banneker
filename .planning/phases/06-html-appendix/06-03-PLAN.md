<objective>
Update the installer manifest and tests to include Phase 6 template files (banneker-publisher agent and banneker-appendix command).

Purpose: Every new template file must be registered in BANNEKER_FILES for install/uninstall tracking, and covered by integration and smoke tests. This follows the exact pattern established in Phase 4 Plan 04 (04-04-PLAN.md) and Phase 5 Plan 03 (05-03-PLAN.md).

Output: Updated `lib/constants.js` with new file entries, updated integration and smoke tests.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update lib/constants.js with Phase 6 file entries</name>
  <files>lib/constants.js</files>
  <action>
Add Phase 6 template files to the manifest constants in `lib/constants.js`:

**BANNEKER_FILES array — add 2 entries:**
- `'banneker-appendix.md'` — command file (installed to `{runtime}/commands/`)
- `'agents/banneker-publisher.md'` — agent file (installed to `{runtime}/agents/`)

**AGENT_FILES array — add 1 entry:**
- `'banneker-publisher.md'`

Follow the existing ordering pattern: command files are listed with other command files (root-level entries), agent files are listed with other agent files (agents/ prefix entries).

Do NOT modify RUNTIMES, VERSION, RUNTIME_CHOICES, or CONFIG_FILES — those are unchanged for Phase 6.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `node -e "import { BANNEKER_FILES, AGENT_FILES } from './lib/constants.js'; console.log('BANNEKER_FILES:', BANNEKER_FILES); console.log('AGENT_FILES:', AGENT_FILES);"` and confirm:
- BANNEKER_FILES contains 'banneker-appendix.md' and 'agents/banneker-publisher.md'
- AGENT_FILES contains 'banneker-publisher.md'
  </verify>
  <done>
- BANNEKER_FILES includes both new Phase 6 entries (command + agent)
- AGENT_FILES includes banneker-publisher.md
- Existing entries unchanged
  </done>

  <name>Task 2: Update integration and smoke tests for Phase 6 files</name>
  <files>test/integration/skill-validation.test.js, test/smoke/full-install.test.js</files>
  <action>
**Integration tests (`test/integration/skill-validation.test.js`):**

Add test cases for the 2 new template files, following the exact pattern used for Phase 4 and Phase 5 files:

1. **banneker-appendix command test:** Validate that `templates/commands/banneker-appendix.md` has valid YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields. The `name` field should equal `banneker-appendix`.

2. **banneker-publisher agent test:** Validate that `templates/agents/banneker-publisher.md` has valid YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields. The `name` field should equal `banneker-publisher`.

Follow the existing test structure — look at how banneker-architect, banneker-roadmap, banneker-diagrammer are tested and replicate that pattern exactly.

**Smoke tests (`test/smoke/full-install.test.js`):**

Add verification that new files are installed to correct directories:

1. Verify `banneker-appendix.md` is installed to `{runtime}/commands/banneker-appendix.md`
2. Verify `banneker-publisher.md` is installed to `{runtime}/agents/banneker-publisher.md`

Follow the existing smoke test pattern for verifying file existence after installation.

Run the test suite: `node --test test/integration/skill-validation.test.js` — all tests pass including new Phase 6 tests.
Run smoke tests: `node --test test/smoke/full-install.test.js` — all tests pass including new Phase 6 file verification.
  </verify>
  <done>
- Integration tests validate YAML frontmatter for banneker-appendix command and banneker-publisher agent
- Smoke tests verify both new files install to correct directories
- All existing tests continue to pass
- All new tests pass
  </done>
</task>

<verification>
1. `node --test test/integration/skill-validation.test.js` passes (including new Phase 6 tests)
2. `node --test test/smoke/full-install.test.js` passes (including new Phase 6 file checks)
3. `lib/constants.js` contains all Phase 6 file entries
4. No existing tests broken

<success_criteria>
- BANNEKER_FILES manifest includes both new Phase 6 template files
- AGENT_FILES includes banneker-publisher.md
- Integration tests validate frontmatter for new files
- Smoke tests verify installation paths for new files
- Full test suite passes green
