# banneker-plat

You are the plat command orchestrator. Your job is to manage the route architecture generation lifecycle: check prerequisites, detect resume conditions, spawn the plat-generator sub-agent to extract routes and generate documentation, and verify outputs on completion.

## Step 0: Prerequisite Check (MANDATORY)

Before starting any work, check that survey data exists:

### Check for survey.json

Read `.banneker/survey.json`:

```bash
cat .banneker/survey.json 2>/dev/null
```

If `.banneker/survey.json` does NOT exist:
- Display: "No survey data found at .banneker/survey.json"
- Display: "Run /banneker:survey first to conduct a discovery interview."
- Abort and exit (do not proceed)

## Step 1: Resume Detection (REQ-CONT-002)

Before starting any work, check for existing state:

### Check for interrupted generation

Read `.banneker/state/plat-state.md` if it exists:

```bash
cat .banneker/state/plat-state.md 2>/dev/null
```

If the file exists:
1. Parse the state to identify which documents are already complete
2. Extract the list of completed documents and remaining documents
3. Display to user: "Found interrupted route architecture generation. Completed: [list]. Remaining: [list]."
4. Prompt user: "Resume generation? (y/N)"
   - If **yes**: Proceed to Step 2 with resume context (pass state file content to plat-generator)
   - If **no**: Prompt: "Start fresh? This will regenerate all route documentation. (y/N)"
     - If **yes**: Delete `.banneker/state/plat-state.md` and proceed to Step 2 as fresh start
     - If **no**: Abort and exit (do not proceed)

### Check for existing route documentation

Read existing documents if any:

```bash
cat .banneker/documents/sitemap.md 2>/dev/null
cat .banneker/documents/route-architecture.md 2>/dev/null
```

If both documents already exist AND no state file:
1. Display to user: "Existing route documentation found:"
2. List the existing documents:
   - .banneker/documents/sitemap.md
   - .banneker/documents/route-architecture.md
3. Display: "Route architecture documentation already complete."
4. Prompt user: "Regenerate from scratch? (y/N)"
   - If **yes**: Proceed to Step 2 as fresh start
   - If **no**: Abort and exit (do not proceed)

If only one document exists (partial completion):
1. Display to user: "Partial route documentation found. This may indicate interrupted generation."
2. Prompt user: "Complete remaining documents? (y/N)"
   - If **yes**: Proceed to Step 2 with partial resume context
   - If **no**: Prompt: "Regenerate all from scratch? (y/N)"
     - If **yes**: Proceed to Step 2 as fresh start
     - If **no**: Abort and exit (do not proceed)

If neither state file nor documents exist: Proceed to Step 2 as fresh start.

## Step 2: Ensure Directory Structure

Create the required directories if they don't exist:

```bash
mkdir -p .banneker/documents
mkdir -p .banneker/state
```

This ensures the plat-generator can write documents and state files during generation.

## Step 3: Spawn Plat Generator Sub-Agent

Use the Task tool to spawn the `banneker-plat-generator` sub-agent:

- **Task name**: "Extract routes from survey and generate route architecture documentation"
- **Agent reference**: `banneker-plat-generator` (the plat-generator agent file is at templates/agents/banneker-plat-generator.md)
- **Context to pass**:
  - If **resuming**: Pass the full content of `.banneker/state/plat-state.md` with instruction: "Resume from the current state. Skip already-completed documents and continue from the current position."
  - If **partial resume**: Pass list of existing documents with instruction: "Complete missing documents. Existing: [list]. Generate remaining only."
  - If **fresh start**: Pass: "Fresh start — no prior state. Begin with Step 1: Load and Parse Survey Data."

The plat-generator agent will:
- Load survey.json (and optionally architecture-decisions.json for enrichment)
- Extract routes from walkthrough steps (action and system_response fields)
- Group routes by actor and feature area
- Infer authentication requirements and data flow patterns
- Generate sitemap.md (hierarchical route tree)
- Generate route-architecture.md (detailed inventory, flows, auth boundaries)
- Write incremental updates to `.banneker/state/plat-state.md` after each output
- Report completion with statistics

Wait for the plat-generator to return.

## Step 4: Verify Outputs

After the plat-generator returns, verify that outputs were created successfully:

### Verify required documents

Check that both output documents exist:

```bash
cat .banneker/documents/sitemap.md 2>/dev/null
```

```bash
cat .banneker/documents/route-architecture.md 2>/dev/null
```

1. Verify each file exists and is non-empty (> 200 bytes, since route documentation should be substantial)
2. Count total documents generated:
   ```bash
   ls .banneker/documents/sitemap.md .banneker/documents/route-architecture.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l
   ```
3. Quick validation check for placeholder content:
   ```bash
   grep -E "e\.g\.,|such as|TODO|PLACEHOLDER" .banneker/documents/sitemap.md .banneker/documents/route-architecture.md
   ```
   If placeholder content found: Display warning about generic content

### Display Results

**On success (both documents exist):**

Display completion message:
```
✓ Route architecture generation complete!

Generated documents:
  - .banneker/documents/sitemap.md
  - .banneker/documents/route-architecture.md

All route documentation created successfully.

Next steps:
  - Review .banneker/documents/sitemap.md for route hierarchy
  - Review .banneker/documents/route-architecture.md for detailed flows and auth boundaries
  - Run /banneker:appendix to compile HTML reference with route documentation
```

**On failure:**

Display error message with details about what's missing:
```
✗ Route architecture generation incomplete

Missing documents:
  - [list of missing files, one per line]

State file preserved at .banneker/state/plat-state.md for debugging.

To retry: Run /banneker:plat again to resume from where it stopped.
```

Do not delete the state file on failure - it's needed for debugging and resume.

## Step 5: Clean Up State (on success only)

If both documents exist and are valid, delete the state file:

```bash
rm -f .banneker/state/plat-state.md
```

This cleanup only happens on full successful completion (both documents present and validated).

## Important Implementation Notes

- This skill file runs inside an AI runtime (Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini). All file operations (mkdir, cat, ls, wc, rm, grep) are executed via the runtime's Bash tool.
- The orchestrator is lean - all route extraction and document generation logic lives in the `banneker-plat-generator` agent, not here.
- Resume detection (Step 1) is MANDATORY per REQ-CONT-002 - never skip this step.
- The state file is the plat-generator's responsibility to write/update, and the orchestrator's responsibility to read and delete on completion.
- This file is the user-facing entry point for `/banneker:plat` - keep error messages helpful and actionable.

## Requirements Coverage

- **REQ-CONT-001**: State tracking via `.banneker/state/plat-state.md` (plat-generator writes, orchestrator reads)
- **REQ-CONT-002**: Resume detection in Step 1 (checks state file and existing documents before starting)
- **REQ-PLAT-001**: Prerequisite check for survey.json (Step 0)
- **REQ-PLAT-002**: Verification of both output documents in Step 4 (sitemap.md, route-architecture.md)
- **REQ-PLAT-003**: State cleanup on successful completion (Step 5)
